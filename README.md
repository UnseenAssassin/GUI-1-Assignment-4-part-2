# GUI-1-Assignment-4-Part 2

# Project Description
The purpose of the project is to be a continuation of part 1 by adding the ability to use a slider to input certain values for the horizonal and vertical values.  The slider and the text box are linked so if the user were to slide the slider, it would increase or decrease the number in the text box and if the number in the text box changes so does the slider.  The project also adds in the ability to use tabs to save the tables made.  If the user wants to delete the tabs they can click on the x on the tab to delete it or if they would like to delete more than one tag at a time they can use the checkbox feature to select more than one tag and delete multiple tags at once
